# Furby Revived!
This project is here to decompile the Furby Boom! app.
Furby Boom is owned by [Hasbro Inc.](https://corporate.hasbro.com/en-us)
This decomp will be abandoned, due to my lack of knowledge of Unity. (game freezes when triggering the tutorial egg appearing in your egg carton.)

# Building

1. Get Unity 2022.2.21f1.
2. Open the project.


what else do i say? im not gonna continue working on this decomp.
