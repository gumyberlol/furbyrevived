# Furby Revived!
This project is here to decompile the Furby Boom! app.
Furby Boom is owned by [Hasbro Inc.](https://corporate.hasbro.com/en-us)
This decomp will be abandoned, due to my lack of knowledge of Unity. (game freezes when triggering the tutorial egg appearing in your egg carton.)

# Building

1. Get Unity 2022.2.21f1.
2. Open the project.


what else do i say? im not gonna continue working on this decomp.
if hasbro doesnt like me doing this, they can contact me to remove this repository.
if you wanna help decompiling, contact me on discord: "gumyberlol.".
